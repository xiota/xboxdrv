# Axis Sensitivty Example
# =======================
#
# You can adjust the axis sensitivity by a few means, the sensitivity
# modifier, the deadzone and the response curve. The deadzone is the
# most basic one, it just filters out the noise around the center. The
# sensitivity adjust the sensitivity curve via a simple value, while
# the response curve gives you close to complete control over the axis
# response.
#
# In this example the sensitivity of the left stick is reduced a bit
# when LB is held down, giving you more resolution for small movement,
# and increased when RB is held down. On the right stick all negative
# Y values are removed from the response via an axisfilter

# values between [-1, 1] gives reasonably results, above that is
# allowed to but quickly becomes useless in practice
# [axis-sensitivity]
# X1 = -0.5
# Y1 = -0.5

[xboxdrv]
# messing around with sensitivity can currently screw up diagonal
# movement, using square-axis can sometimes help a bit with that.
