# CH Flightstick Emulation
# ========================
#
# This configuration is for old flight simulations in Dosbox. First
# you have to adjust your Dosbox configuration to interpreted the
# given joystick as CH Flightstick. To do so set in "dosbox.conf":
#
# [joystick]
# joysticktype = ch
#
# With the following configuration your right analog stick will act as
# trottle control, the trigger as rudder. The left stick will be
# expanded to a square movement range and the rest of the buttons acts
# as usual.
#
# For a proper experience you might want to map some of the remaining
# buttons to game specific keyboard keys.
